Setting Up the development environment
======================================

* Clone the repository:

* Install latest ant

    sudo apt-get install ant

* Install mercurial
	
	sudo apt-get install mercurial

* cd datawinners-smartphone/datawinners-smartphone

* Run the following script 
	
    . sdk-setup.sh (This might take a lot of time as it downloads the android SDK on your machine.)

	. dev-setup.sh
